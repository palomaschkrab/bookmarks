# Bookmarks using Vanilla JS #

Created a bookmark following this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIVfDZZeGxM

I had to apply some changes as I used Bootstrap 4.
- Had to change the well that was replaced to use cards class instead on css side
- Had to modify the class for the button as well as for bootstrap 4 there is no btn-default anymore
- Had to add a preventDefault on the delete action to avoid the screen to keep jumping all the way to the top
